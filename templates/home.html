            <p class='background_para'>
                This goal of this study was to see if there was a correlation between
                Google trends data and the amount of money that a movie made. The idea
                for this project came to me after reading Everybody Lies. In that
                book the author uses data from Google Trends to examine human
                behvaior. Thus, I wanted to see if there would be any correlation
                with movies and Google Trends.
